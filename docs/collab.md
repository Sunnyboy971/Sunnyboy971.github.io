# 关于合作 Collaboration

Hi, glad to witness your interest in collaborating with me!

If you have any good idea on those projects below (or any new project), feel free to contact me on GitHub or by email!

Currently receiving/looking for cooperation on several projects. The detail as follows:

目前我在多个项目上接受合作/希望他人的合作。具体如下：

!!! warning "注意"
    Due to academic reasons, time for collaboration cannot be guaranteed. Despite this, I will still read your request *at least every weekend*. So **be patient** and, I am always happy to receive your request!

    出于学业原因，用于合作项目的时间无法保证。即便如此，我也会在*至少每周末*阅读您的需求。请**耐心等待**。

## 软件项目 Software {#software}

### [opsu!](https://github.com/clonewith/opsu)

opsu! is an *unofficial* open-source osu! client originally created by [@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu). Now I'm adding some new features to it and will continuously maintain it for years.

### [osu!(lazer)](https://github.com/clonewith/osu)

The future – and final – iteration of the osu! game client which marks the beginning of an open era.

Currently I'm trying to make some changes or improvements on this, including:

- Minor UI / UX changes
- Tournament client (a.k.a. osu!tournament) changes

Mostly I work on the tournament client part, implementing innovative mappool layouts, button and form styles, and also animations! Most of this works for [osu! FumoFumo Cup](https://offfc.github.io), and is done with my dear teammates in the development team.

Absolutely this would persist for *really* a long time, cause it's interesting for me to dig into the infrastructure of this great project!

### [かたわ少女: Re-Engineered](https://fhs.sh)

**Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered** is a fan-made modernization of the classic visual novel of *Four Leaf Studios* by **Fleeting Heartbeat Studios**, and I'm porting the original translation into *Simplified Chinese*.

是藉由 *Four Leaf Studios* 的原作重新编写的新版本，具有多方面的功能改进。我找到了原来的汉化版本，原有翻译已迁移完毕，欢迎前去支持！

## osu! 作图 Mapping {#mapping}

真的会有人来浇作图嘛？
